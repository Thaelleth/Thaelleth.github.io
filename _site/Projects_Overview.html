        <h2> About </h2>
        <p> I've taken part in all of the projects depicted on this site. Any other project members will be credited as
            appropriate (with names or +X if they wish not to be named). Any discontinued (at least for now) projects
            will be marked as such. A download link will be available for the latest build as long as the project is in
            a stage where building a working version is possible (menus/game mechanincs don't cause a crash). I don't
            quarantee that any build is truly playable, only that they don't crash and allow anyone interested to test
            the game. I'm no graphics specialist/modeler/artist so don't expect any visually pleasing games just yet.

            <h3> <a class="embedded_link" href="Flappy_Bird_Clone.html"> Flappy Bird Clone</a> </h3>
            <p> As the first guided game project we all made a mobile game with the same basic idea (basically copying
                Flappy Bird). We were encouraged to team up (2-4 per team) and also learn some mode of collaboration.
                The project ended up being fairly simple and me and my partner in crime ended up finishing it pretty
                fast. Working with Android was the biggest problem since neither of us we're really that interested in
                mobile games and had no prior experience with them.

            <h3> <a class="embedded_link" href="AimTrainer.html"> AimTrainer</a> </h3>
            <p> A project I worked on during my free time. I ended up testing out different approaches to working on
                modeling and graphics after I finished coding the core mechanics of the game. Developed to provide a
                adaptive and intuitive workspace to improve one's aim for FPS style games. Marked complete though I
                could still improve or add functionality. The graphics need a proper remake at some point atleast.

            <h3> <a class="embedded_link" href="Project_X.html"> Project X</a> </h3>
            <p> A duo project (again) started at the beginning of our second year of studies and that's been
                discontinued because of the sheer scale of it. It was going to be a FPS game where the player could
                switch between two planes of existence/two different timeline/past and present. We hadn't yet chosen
                which idea fit the game best. Currently the core gameplay mechanics are mostly done (although somewhat
                broken here and there thanks to animations and custom models) and the level is coming along well if
                fairly slowly (lack of experience with modeling). We'd just finished couple of enemy models and were
                implementing animations and repairing the original code.

            <h3> <a class="embedded_link" href="SR3D.html">SR3D</a> </h3>
            <p>A fast paced platformer made with the Godot Game Engine as a foray outside Unity. Also we wanted to
                create at the very least a local network multiplayer and since Unity doesn't currently have a good
                internal solution for it we decided on Godot. Unreal was also thought of for a moment but we abandoned
                that because of the difficulty of C++ game development and lack of interest in visual scripting
                languages.

            <p>A recently started projects that's to be a stealth strategy game where the player controls multiple
                characters to complete mission objetives. No story or world has been locked down yet and we're in the
                process of coming up with proper ideas for this game. Basic player controls have been implemented but
                there's no UI of any kind yet. We're aiming to get a few environment assets created next to establish
                some kind of visual style for the game.
