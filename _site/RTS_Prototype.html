            <h3> General information </h3>
            <p>This prototype is more of a learning opportunity where the main idea is to try and replicate some of the
                mechanics that I've seen and liked in some RTS games. This also allows me to delve more deeply into
                <a class="embedded_link" href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> and C# features like
                inheritance, interfaces and polymorphism. The UI will, once I get to it,
                probably be quite a challenge since it needs to adapt to show basically any kind of Entity information.
            </p>
            <p>I'm compiling an Utilities class that will hold a collection of general purpose methods that can be used
                elsewhere to make code more readable. Once I'm done with this prototype I might publish the Utilities
                class somewhere (Github Gists?) and add a link to it here. It'll hold stuff for getting a certain
                component from a monobehaviour, or getting a world point based on cursor screen position for example.

            <h3> Current features </h3>
            <p>The prototype currently has no UI so all commands must be given through hotkeys. Units can be commanded
                to move, patrol or attack. There's a specialized Worker Unit that can be used to gather resources or
                build structures. Structures can then be used to spend resources on creating more units.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h3>Future plan</h3>
            <p>The next target is looking for bugs, testing all the systems thoroughly to straighten out all the kinks I
                might find. After that I'll probably work on that UI. Nothing fancy of course, just something
                functional and simple.
            </p>
            <p>There's no plan to make this into a proper project any time soon. This is mainly because of the scope of
                creating a fully fledged RTS. I'd have to work on Unit design, story, balancing... basically everything
                on my own. I quite simply don't have all the necessary graphical/audio skills yet to work alone on a
                project of this scale, at least not if I aim to get the end result that I'd want. I'll work on smaller
                projects to develop those skills before maybe returning to this one some time in the future.
