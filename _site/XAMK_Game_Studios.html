            <h3> General information </h3>
            <p>This was an over-the-summer internship position as the Lead Coder for a 12 member team. Our goal was to
                develop two games for separate clients by the end of summer. It didn't go quite as planned, partly
                because we couldn't get proper contact with both clients and partly because there was just too much work
                for mere three and a half months with such a small and inexperienced team.
            </p>
            <p>The general team composition was six coders (excluding me), three leads/managers (including me), two
                artists and one tester. Most of the work was conducted completely remotely. Some odd meetings here and
                there, escpecially with the clients, were local.
            </p>
            <p>Most of my work was on managing the coders' work and writing the tasks for them. We had a separate Kanban
                board on <a class="embedded_link" href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> for tracking
                task progress while the actual files were stored in a <a class="embedded_link"
                    href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> repository. The games themselves were made
                with <a class="embedded_link" href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a>.

        <h3> The games </h3>
        <p>Our first project, and the one we had better client involvement in, was to create a city exploration game for
            mobile platforms, targeted mostly at children under the age of 10. The main idea was to get children
            exploring a city and moving while doing so. We started with a pretty ambitious idea that was ultimately cut
            down to remove features and make it safer for the children.
        </p>
        <p>Our second project was to make a game that could teach children the basics of programming, playable in
            (theoretically) any browser. Our first client contact was AFTER the initial internship had already ended and
            most of us were working extra to get practice hours for our studies. The game wasn't as much for teaching
            programming in a specific language as it was for introducing the player to some of the main principles of
            programming and the concept of applying logic in specified chuncks to get the desired behaviour.

                <h3> Mobile exploration/excercise game </h3>
                <p>This game ended up being constrained to a specific part of a city for added safety. The general gist
                    of it is that there are markers on a map that you can physically go to (GPS tracking on) and do
                    some tasks that are configurable by the user. By default only easy tasks were on. Things that,
                    theoretically, anyone should be able to do.
                </p>
                <p>GPS tracking part is what is supposed to get children to move. Of course there is a disclaimer right
                    after splash screen that basically says that any exploration should be done under adult supervision.
                    Also all loading screens (that aren't truly necessary) have a short reminder about being aware of
                    your surroundings.
                </p>
                <p>The map markers are predefined and the locations can be chosen fairly accurately. From what I last
                    saw/heard the player should be within 50 m from a marker to access it, so they don't need to be
                    right at the marker, but nearby. This allowed us to pick locations that are either historically
                    significant or otherwise nice to visit. Also, we obviously only picked locations that are actually
                    safe for children.

                <h3> Coding game </h3>
                <p>This game is basically a Tower Defense but with elements that introduce some programming or
                    logic concepts to the game.
                </p>
                <p>Towers can be configured to act according to conditions (basically
                    boolean logic). There's also a character, that collects resources, that can be "programmed" to move
                    according to a set of commands (order of operations, command pattern).
                </p>
                <p>Lastly there's a bit of metagame that I personally had no direct part in that is supposed to be for
                    the more artistic children. Basically it's a list of rules that the children should follow on
                    creating art for the game. If fully realized, this would end up with the submissions coming to the,
                    at that point in time, project team who then choose one of the drawings to be a winner. The winning
                    drawing then, theoretically, gets implemented into the game in some way.
