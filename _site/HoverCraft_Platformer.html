        <h3> General information </h3>
        <p> This was going to be a platformer game with some puzzle elements thrown in. The original idea was that we'd make a game where using gravity and momentum would solve most problems when used correctly. Timing and good perception of one's surrounding
            would be the key characteristics to smoothly advance in the game. This project is on hold due to the lack of motivation and losing interest in the original idea (project was started just before the summer break). Depending on how my other
            projects advance and whether or not I get any other ideas I MIGHT continue this project at some point. Currently the future doesn't look too good for this project.
