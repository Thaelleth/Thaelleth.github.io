            <p> All models and some textures (some are from <a class="embedded_link" href="https://cc0textures.com/"
                    target="_blank">CC0 Textures</a>) are selfmade. This project was mostly me learning my limits and
                some time management. The central game mechanics
                are finished but there is still room for more testing and development. Some optimization could be done
                at some point in the future. The UI and player HUD (very minimalistic) are complete and working. </p>

            <h3> Gameplay </h3>
            <p> There aren't any story or adventure elements in the game. The whole idea is to spend time trying to
                improve one's aim in an environement that's been specifically planned for the kind of gun in use. So far
                I've created a basic pistol, an assault
                rifle, a shotgun and a sniper rifle. Each weapons has a different bullet/hitscan damage and spread
                value. The pistol is the most basic one and doesn't implement any additional element besides a normal
                zoom. The assault rifle has the highest
                fire rate and the second largest spread value while also implementing a basic zoom. The shotgun has the
                highest damage potential per shot but also has the second slowest fire rate. The shotgun also has the
                largest potential spread and
                the basic zoom. Last but not least we have the sniper rifle which has almost no spread, significantly
                high shot damage and increased zoom level. The targets can be configured with preset movement patterns
                and some settings can be changed
                ingame.

            <p> The modeling that I did was done with <a class="embedded_link" href="https://www.blender.org/download/"
                    target="_blank">Blender 2.83</a>. I created models for the four weapons and some environmental
                pieces to make the ranges a bit more realistic.
                The UI is minimalistic and functional. There's currently no audio in the game and anything I might add
                is going to be from an external source.
