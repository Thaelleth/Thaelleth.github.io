            <h3> General information </h3>
            <p> A starter project to introduce us to game projects. Every team began with the same idea and ended up with different implementations of the same mechanics. I'm fairly sure that none of us used the same method for movement. Most textures were taken from around the internet with little regard to copyrights (in our defense, we never intend to publish any of it). Two music clips we're downloaded from <a class="embedded_link" href="https://opengameart.org/" target="_blank"> opengameart.org</a>. We ended up with a fairly good looking (if one doesn't take note of how we hop around with an airplane and there are WTC towers as obstacles) game that works well. The biggest hurdle was getting it to Android for testing.

            <h3> Gameplay </h3>
            <p> We decided on a very simple input system. Just tap anywhere on the screen and the plane hops up a little. The UI includes a score on the upper left corner and a timer on the upper right corner. When you start the game you enter a menu where you can choose to start a new run or quit the game. After a run you return to the menu and the latest score and time are displayed.

            <h3> Visual/Aural </h3>
            <p> Nothing in our game is self made (well nothing but the code) and we don't take any credit for the outlook of the game (though neither do I take any blame for it). When the player reaches 30 points the music changes to better fit the increasing speed.
