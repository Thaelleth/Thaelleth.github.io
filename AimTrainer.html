            <h3> General information </h3>
            <p> All models and textures will be selfmade and any audio is going to be from an external source (credited where necessary (I have absolutely no talent for music) ). This is mostly so I can learn to be as self sufficient as possible in developing games. The central game mechanics are pretty much finished by this point and there shouldn't be any need for drastic changes or large amounts of additional coding. Some optimization might be done at some point in the future which, in turn, might take a large chunk of time depending on how much I've learned by that point. The UI and player HUD (very minimalistic) are complete if sparcely textured at the moment. No texturing or modeling has been done yet and all content currently uses basic primitive shapes. </p>

            <h3> Gameplay </h3>
            <p> There aren't any story or adventure elements in the game. The whole idea is to spend time trying to improve one's aim in an environement that's been specifically planned for the kind of gun in use. So far I've created a basic pistol, an assault rifle, a shotgun and a sniper rifle. Each weapons has a different bullet/hitscan damage and spread value. The pistol is the most basic one and doesn't implement any additional element besides a normal zoom. The assault rifle has the highest fire rate and the second largest spread value while also implementing a basic zoom. The shotgun has the highest damage potential per shot but also has the second slowest fire rate. The shotgun also has the largest potential spread and the basic zoom. Last but not least we have the sniper rifle which has almost no spread, significantly high shot damage and increased zoom level. The targets can be configured with preset movement patterns and some settings can be changed ingame.  </p>

            <h3> Visual/Aural </h3>
            <p> The little modeling that I've started but never completed was done with Blender 2.79. There are no ongoing models for this project specifically but some assets from other projects might be later adapted to also fit in this one. Any future modeling or texturing will be done in Blender 2.8x with texture painting or in GIMP as UV mappable images. There's currently no audio in the game and anything I might add is going to be from an external source. </p>

        <p> The game engine used for this project is <a class="embedded_link" href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank"> Unity</a> Engine 2018.3 and version history/cloud saving is done to a <a class="embedded_link" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"> Github</a> repositorty. All coding so far has been done with <a class="embedded_link" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/" target="_blank"> Visual Studio</a> Community 2018. Any later changes will be done with a newer version. Some notes are made to a plain text file. </p>
