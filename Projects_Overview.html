        <h2> About </h2>
        <p> I've taken part in all of the projects depicted on this site. Any other project members will be credited as appropriate (with names or +X if they wish not to be named). Any discontinued (at least for now) projects will be marked as such. A download link will be available for the latest build as long as the project is in a stage where building a working version is possible (menus/game mechanincs don't cause a crash). I don't quarantee that any build is truly playable, only that they don't crash and allow anyone interested to test the game. I'm no graphics specialist/modeler/artist so don't expect any visually pleasing games just yet. Any graphics you do see I've made myself or credited to the original creator.

            <h3> <a class="embedded_link" href="Flappy_Bird_Clone.html"> Flappy Bird Clone</a> </h3>
            <p> As the first guided game project we all made a mobile game with the same basic idea (basically copying Flappy Bird). We were encouraged to team up (2-4 per team) and also learn some mode of collaboration. The project ended up being fairly simple and me and my partner in crime ended up finishing it pretty fast. Working with Android was the biggest problem since neither of us we're that interested in mobile games and had no prior experience with them.

            <h3> <a class="embedded_link" href="HoverCraft_Platformer.html"> Hovercraft Platformer</a> </h3>
            <p> A quick filler project started at the end of the first years last period. Currently on (infinite) hiatus. Main point was to make a platformer game where the player moves with a hovering craft (my original idea was from Mass Effect 2 <a class="embedded_link" href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/M-44_Hammerhead" target="_blank">M-44 Hammerhead</a>) and solves occasional puzzles with physics based movement. This project was also a collaboration. At it's current stage there is simply a testing level and a very shaky hovering craft. We simply couldn't think of an easy way to get the hover to work like we wanted it to and ended up abandoning this project.

            <h3> <a class="embedded_link" href="AimTrainer.html"> AimTrainer</a> </h3>
            <p> A project I worked on during the summer. I ended up testing out different approaches to working on modeling and graphics after I finished coding the core mechanics of the game. Developed to provide a adaptive and intuitive workspace to improve one's aim for FPS style games. On a hiatus for now while I work on Project X. This project might get abandoned depending on whether I manage to find some actual work for the coming summers.

            <h3> <a class="embedded_link" href="Project_X.html"> Project X</a> </h3>
            <p> A duo project (again) started at the beginning of our second year of studies and the one that I'm currently working on. It's going to be a FPS game where the player can switch between two planes of existence/two different timeline/past and present. We haven't yet chosen which idea fits the game best. Currently the core gameplay mechanics are mostly done (although somewhat broken here and there thanks to animations and custom models) and the level is coming along well if fairly slowly (lack of experience with modeling). We've just finished couple of enemy models and are implementing animations and repairing the original code.
