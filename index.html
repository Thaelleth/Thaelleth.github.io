            <h2> About this site </h2>
            <p> This site is dedicated to displaying projects done during my studies. Updates may be few and far between
                (depending on workload) but I'll do my best to try and keep things up to date. The "last modified" date
                is displayed at the bottom of the page (before the footer). If one actively follows my progress they can
                check the date on each page and see whether its been updated since they last saw it. </p>

            <h2> My tools </h2>
            <p> I mainly use C# to script my projects in <a class="embedded_link" href="https://unity.com/"
                    target="_blank">Unity</a> or <a class="embedded_link" href="https://godotengine.org/"
                    target="_blank">Godot</a>, though in Godot I sometimes use
                GDscript
                for it's simplicity. I've also learned C++, PHP and a little bit of lua. For modelling I use
                <a class="embedded_link" href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>. I'm also
                familiar with some photogrammetry software like Alice Vision <a class="embedded_link"
                    href="https://alicevision.org/" target="_blank">Meshroom</a>, retopology with <a
                    class="embedded_link" href="https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes" target="_blank">Instant
                    Meshes</a> and some predefined asset creation with <a class="embedded_link"
                    href="https://www.daz3d.com/" target="_blank">Daz Studio</a> and <a class="embedded_link"
                    href="https://www.evolved-software.com/treeit/treeit" target="_blank">Tree It</a>. I've also looked
                at <a class="embedded_link" href="https://armorpaint.org/" target="_blank">ArmorPaint</a> and
                <a class="embedded_link" href="https://quixel.com/mixer" target="_blank">Quixel Mixer</a> for
                asset painting, though I haven't needed to use them yet. For 2D
                painting I mainly work with <a class="embedded_link" href="https://krita.org/en/"
                    target="_blank">Krita</a>, photomanipulation with <a class="embedded_link"
                    href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a> and vector graphics with <a
                    class="embedded_link" href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">InkScape</a>. So mainly open
                source software or otherwise free products.

            <h2> About the projects here </h2>
            <p> All the projects on display on this site are projects that I've been involved in to some level
                (usually as a programmer (to some extent as a modeller (to an even lesser extent as an artist))). Any
                build
                of a game that's been published here is supposed to be a working build meaning no crashes or game
                breaking bugs. </p>
