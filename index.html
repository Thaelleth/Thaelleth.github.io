        <h2> About this site </h2>
        <p> This site is dedicated to displaying projects done during my (Aki) studies. Updates may be few and far between (depending on workload) but I'll do my best to try and keep things up to date. The "last modified" date is displayed at the bottom of the page (before the footer). If one actively follows my progress they can check the date on each page and see whether its been updated since they last saw it. Also there are no cookies to be had on this site, just pure HTML/CSS. </p>

            <h2> About the projects here </h2>
            <p> All the projects on display on this site are projects that I've been involved in to some level (usually as a porgrammer (to some extent as a modeler (to an even lesser extent as an artist))). Any build of a game that's been published here is supposed to be a working build meaning no crashes or gamebreaking bugs. </p>

            <h2> About me </h2>
            <p> Aki Koivula is my name and I'm a student at XAMK <a class="embedded_link" href="https://www.xamk.fi/en/frontpage/" target="_blank"> (South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences)</a>. I'm on my second year here and studying to become a game programmer (basically a plain programmer at that due to the lack of artistic or musical talent).  </p>
