            <h3> General information </h3>
            <p>All models, textures, sounds we will make ourselves (unless we're extremely lazy) to learn aspects of game development other than just coding. Neither of us are great artists or modelers so the overall visual outlook of the game might (more like WILL) be lacking. Since the latest addition of custom characters and animations we'll have to do some addiotional coding to accomondate those changes (there were no animations initially). None of the game assets have any high quality textures or additional texture mappings yet and the UI is very basic (currently featuring no HUD).

        <h3> Gameplay </h3>
        <p> The main gameplay mechanic in the game is the ability to switch between two planes. The player can use this ability to avoid dangers, get through debris, gain information or sneak up on one's enemies. It isn't decided yet how far to adventure side we're taking this. It'll mostly depend on motivation and possible other project ideas that may take precedence. The enemy AI is currently pretty simple and won't be able to shoot the player at all if one moves sideways even a little. So far it's done intentionally to preserve performance to other game mechanics. We've also limited the AI's detection areas. The game has basic Shooter controls that can be remapped ingame. Saving settings or progress isn't supported yet even though implementing a save/load is very much a possibility.

            <h3> Visual/aural </h3>
            <p> All of the modeling will be done with Blender 2.8x (depending on which versions are released during development) and texturing done either in Blender itself (texture painting) or externally with GIMP. Some assets might be borrowed from other projects but will still be done with the same software. Currently we have no plan on how to create or modify game sounds or background music and no assets on that side have been created (not even a folder in project files).

            <h3> Game Engine </h3>
            <p> We recently upgraded our project (2019.2) to a newer <a class="embedded_link" href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank"> Unity</a> Engine (2019.3) to gain access to the newest features. We are using a <a class="embedded_link" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"> Github</a> repository as the central collaboration tool. <a class="embedded_link" href="https://tortoisegit.org/" target="_blank"> TortoiseGit</a> will be the program of choise for commiting changes. <a class="embedded_link" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/" target="_blank"> Visual Studio</a> Community 2019 will be used as external code editor for Unity. Some additional notes and other random data might be saved as plain text files for ease of access.
